# GCD and LCM (Part 2)

# Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and return the LCM of the two numbers.
# Examples

def lcm(num1, num2)
  num1.lcm(num2)
end

puts lcm(3, 5) #➞ 15

puts lcm(14, 28) #➞ 28

puts lcm(4, 6) #➞ 12

# Notes

#     Don't forget to return the result.
#     You may want to use the GCD function to make this a little easier.
#     LCM stands for least common multiple, the smallest multiple of both integers.
